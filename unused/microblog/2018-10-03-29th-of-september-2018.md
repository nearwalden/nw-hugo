I think [May Mobility](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/29/autonomous-shuttle-startup-may-mobility-expands-to-a-third-u-s-city/) is one of the most interesting autonomous vehicle companies around.  See [my previous post](https://nearwalden.com/who-owns-tomorrows-autonomous-city-cars/) for thoughts on the future of autonomous vehicles in cities, and why some will want to take more control.
