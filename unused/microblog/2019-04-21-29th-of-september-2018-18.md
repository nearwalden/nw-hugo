[Good post](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2019/4/8/mechanical-turks) by Benedict Evans on evolution of people and algorithms. There's an important last point that he doesn't get to:  training-based machine learning is only as good as the teachers, i.e. the humans that create the training data.  Cats are easy, but not everything is.
