Richard Koman reports on O'Reilly net about [Lessons from the Internet Bookmobile.](//www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2002/10/18/bookmobile')  Travelling the country with Brewster, Caslon et al, Richard highlights some of the reactions he got and what he thinks it meant to various institutions.  

This event is vintage Brewster.  When I worked with him in the early days of my career he always was coming at problems from new and interesting directions.  We were successful at some things that were probably close to impossible, and we probably made some easy problems harder by trying a more difficult path.  Great to see Brewster having the resources to take this grand creativity to serious issues that affect us all.
