Here's who I like and don't for online shopping so far this year:





**Big Winner:**  [Zappos](http://www.zappos.com).  Great selection and free shipping. Ordered at 11:00pm, ship confirmation came at 2:30am the same night.  Free shipping on returns, too!





**Doing good:**  [B&H Photo](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/), [Patagonia](http://www.patagonia.com/), [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/).  Good shopping experience, reasonable shipping rates, good web notifications.





**Big losers:**  [Sundance](http://www.sundancecatalog.com/), [Circuit City](http://www.circuitcity.com/).  I was going to buy something small on Sundance last night and they were going to charge me $11 for 7-10 business day shipping (10 days would put it past XMAS), and a minimum of $22 for anything faster.  My electronic shopping cart is still sitting in the aisle where I left it.  With Circuit City I placed an order on 11/27 with 3 day shipping.  The first item arrived 3 days later, while the second had the same estimated arrival date, but no shipping info.  After a week I called and they said they'd check into it and call me in 3-5 days.  And no, I couldn't cancel the order (apparently they thought I might have received it and was trying to get my money back.  Called again 5 days later and they said that yes, it had never been shipped, and that they would ship a new one within 3 days.  No, the women in India politely told me, you still can't cancel the order.  Looooser.
