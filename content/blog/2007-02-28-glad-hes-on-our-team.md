Sometimes you run into someone who's a pain in the ass when he's on the other team, but you love having him on your team.  Tim Bray is such a person, as in his recent [Udell and Vinoski](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/02/27/Udell-Vinowski): _"Hey Jon, our criticisms of WS-* are specific and have to do with issues of process and stability and technical quality and a demonstrated lack of interoperability. It is badly-engineered technology, using it will increase the likelihood that your project fails, and it is not suitable for use by conscientious IT professionals."_
