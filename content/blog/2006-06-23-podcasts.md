A couple of podcasts to check out:






  * I was at Stanford for the opening of the new [Center for Computation Earth and Environmental Sciences (CEES)](http://cees.stanford.edu/), and did [a podcast with Michael Johnson of Podtech](http://www.podtech.net/?p=780). 
  * Bill McDonough, environmental design visionary and co-author of ["Cradle to Cradle"](http://www.mcdonough.com/cradle_to_cradle.htm) stopped by Sun and [visited with Sun CEO, Jonathan Schwartz](http://www.sun.com/rss/eco_podcast.xml). This is the first of a new podcast series on eco issues that we'll be doing - let us know what you think!




Also, stop by [Jonathan's blog](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan) if you haven't lately - a number of recent posts on the energy issues facing CIOs.
