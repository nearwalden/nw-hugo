[Ed Felten's suggestions](//www.freedom-to-tinker.com/archives/000684.html") for monitoring and filtering what your kids watch totally resonated with me.  It's not a hard-core architecture enforced approach, but instead an architecture enabled approach which balances practicality and other lessons you'd like to teach your kids.  













We already have our kids PC in the family room for the same general reason (but also have the same issue early in the morning!).
