The [Solyndra bankruptcy](http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/27/us-solyndra-bankruptcy-hearing-idUSTRE78Q4BW20110927) has, not unexpectedly, resulted in a wide range of reactions.  On one end we have "This was a horrible investment and waste of taxpayers' money.  We should shut down the whole program," and on the other end "Every investment has risks, and if you want success on a big problem there will be some minor setbacks.  This is totally healthy and expected."





I found myself having conflicting reactions, with my rational side understanding the portfolio perspective, my business instinct telling me that Solyndra was a really bad investment, and my energy innovation advocate persona saying "That money could have doubled or tripled the size of ARPA-E for this year!".





All of these reactions lead us to a set of important questions that no one seems to have addressed. Is Solyndra representative of the other investments in the portfolio?  Can I feel bad about Solyndra but still be positive about the rest of the portfolio?  Are loan guarantees really a useful tool in the federal energy innovation arsenal?  These are important questions, as [the program continues to be a topic of discussion in ongoing budget negotiations](http://www.politico.com/morningenergy/0911/morningenergy342.html).





In the spirit of the [Energy Innovation Tracker](http://www.energyinnovation.us/) I have used publicly available information to analyze the DOE loan guarantee portfolio, and to get a handle on whether it is money well spent or not.  I have captured this in a paper that is available in a number of forms:  [web page](http://www.nearwalden.com/blog/analysis-of-the-doe-loan-program), [Word file](http://www.nearwalden.com/blog/files/DOE-loans.docx), and [PDF](http://www.nearwalden.com/blog/files/DOE-loans.pdf).
