In [Moving forward on VOIP](//werbach.com/blog/2003/10/22.html#a1278'), Kevin Werbach says he's worried about trying to distinguish VOIP regulations based on the nature of the network (private, public, etc).  I'll go a step farther than Kevin and state flat out that this makes no sense.  Firewalls and distinctions between networks is not a feature - it's a problem that messes things up every day.  It's all IP (is Voice Over IP for heaven's sake) so it is one network.  Any arbitrary distinctions will be worked around immediately.
