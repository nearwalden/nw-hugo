Kevin Werbach [hits it on the head](//werbach.com/blog/2003/09/11.html#a1158').  Just because the RIAA does stupid things, doesn't make copying 'their' product and giving it away free to others any less wrong.  The game on this field is going to be reduced to an increasingly ugly set of brawls, with blame on every side:  side A (RIAA), side B (full blown sharers) and the referee (current copyright laws).  We need to move to another playing field where we all of these elements have a chance of changing.  However, the RIAA key equipment to play the game and the referee will only change slowly, so if we want a new game the RIAA will have to lead us there.  Otherwise there's plenty of subsitutes on the sharing side so that we can keep brawling for a very long time.
