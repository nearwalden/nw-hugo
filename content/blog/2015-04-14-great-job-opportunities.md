There's a lot going on  at [Applied Invention](http://ai.co/), and I wanted to highlight some specific talent that we're currently in the market for.  If you have any interest or questions please email me at 'dd' at this domain.





The first two positions are with our partner, [Dark Sky](http://darkskyapp.com/) (web-version is currently [here](http://forecast.io)).  Adam, one of the Dark Sky co-founders, [wrote an awesome blog post](http://blog.forecast.io/dark-sky-has-a-new-owner/) when we cemented our partnership a couple of months ago.  Adam and Jay are great to work with, and if anything the potential of our partnership feels even bigger than the day we inked the deal.





We're looking to fill two Dark Sky positions in the broader Boston area: a mobile app developer with a near-term focus on Android, and a versatile back-end developer who can also help out with operations.  More info is available at the [Dark Sky jobs page](http://darksky.net/jobs).  This is a great chance to join the company that is revolutionizing how weather predictions are created and communicated.





As part of another partnership we are working with software entrepreneur Adam Omansky, who has a proven track record in the construction industry.  While the details of Adam's new venture are still under wraps, he's looking for a lead engineer/architect for the new endeavor.  The offering will have a core of big data and predictive analytics, with the usual browser and mobile front ends.  This position will also be in Boston, and its a great chance to get in on the ground floor of a new startup.





Finally, we've got needs over the upcoming months within Applied Invention itself.  If you've got experience with complex web applications, mobile apps, big data or predictive analytics, please reach out and we can discuss specific opportunities.
