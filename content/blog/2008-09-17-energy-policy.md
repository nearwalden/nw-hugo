Interesting discussion with some Sun stakeholders today.  Their question was whether Sun could taken more active role in clean energy supply policy.  My answer was that we aren't experts, and that it wasn't clear we had any influence.





We're going to continue to discuss this.  It make sense that we care to some extent, but if the proposed market mechanisms are effective, then it not clear we what we're adding.





More to come on this, I'm sure.
