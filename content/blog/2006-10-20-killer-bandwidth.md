Need to move 2 petabytes from LA to San Francisco?  If your data was already stored in a [Blackbox](http://www.sun.com/blackbox), you could get over 350Gb/sec!





Here's the calculation:



  * 12 hours to load, travel and unload, or 43,200 seconds
  * 2 petabytes (that's 2 million billion bytes)
  * ~46 GBytes/sec or 368Gb/sec

Maybe our disks better come with a MPG rating!
