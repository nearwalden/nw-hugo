Today I'm taking the EuroStar from London to Brussels through the Chunnel.  Cool!





No WiFi on the train, but good cell reception and an outlet for my laptop.





Update:  The Chunnel is quickly dark and boring, and the EuroStar broke down in Lille, then limped into Brussels 1.5 hours late.  Yikes!
