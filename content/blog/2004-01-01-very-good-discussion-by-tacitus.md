Very good discussion by Tacitus of communism and the Cold War.  It's pretty amazing to me how quickly we forget that that was a real war.  The Cold War resembled its predecessors in that it had a clear front, however it was radically different in that it had no traditional battles.  Our new War against Terrorism is interesting in the lack of a front (or even a clearly defined 'enemy', short of some visible ring leaders').
