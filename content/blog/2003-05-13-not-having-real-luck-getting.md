Not having real luck getting a stable Radio installation on RedHat9 on wine.  Have it basically working, but it uses lots and lots of system resources and has a few quirks here and there.  Will probably stick with Radio on my Mac laptop for now, and decide what to do later on in the year when I shop for a new desktop.

Some notes:








  * quirky setting required for Wine 20020408 on RedHat 9 - LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5


  * I couldn't get Radio to work on Wine on RedHat 9 with the Wine dlls - needed to use the Win98 installation on my system.  Lots of things didn't work - too much hair to debug.
