I'm just catching up with the [ proposal by Lawrence Lessig](//cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/archives/cooper.shtml') and all of the resulting discussion.  

As a software professional, the post that most hit home for me was [ Sandy Wilbourn's post ](//radio.weblogs.com/0109018/2002/08/28.html') which touched on the underlying complexity of executing the idea.  

I think there's some especially tricky questions around the issue of what kind of software is covered.  If I write a piece of software for a company under contract to them, is that covered?  How about if design and sell a product specfically for a internal use of a company, or the government?  These seem problematic if they are covered, but if they aren't I'm sure we'd see Microsoft's "Personalized Software Products" initiative very quickly.

Other than the complexity, I actually can't find much wrong with the proposal. The problem is that I actually can't find much right with it either, mainly because I don't understand how anyone's behavior changes.  The main thing is that the halflife of software is so short -- who would benefit today from the source code to the versions of Windows pre '95?  On the flip side, I also don't buy [ Dave Winer's argument ](//scriptingnews.userland.com/moresSource') that Symantec would have been reluctant to buy MORE with such a law in place.  The only interesting concept I've heard is around 'orphaned' software, but the overall benefit of even that seems like a stretch. 

This thing gets more interesting if you say 2 years instead of 10, but for every good thing I can think of bad things.  I think that really does dis-incentivize alot of positive activity.  

I'm glad to see some creative ideas thrown out, but I think we'll need some more before we get somewhere.
