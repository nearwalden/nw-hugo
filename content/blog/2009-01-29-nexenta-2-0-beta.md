I like to try out new linux and opensolaris distros.  Have started playing with [Nexenta](www.nexenta.org) which has the interesting feature of an opensolaris kernel with Debian packages and package management.  Its not perfect, but I like the direction.





I'm still working on getting X up.  The method listed in [the FAQ](http://www.nexenta.org/os/FAQ) that worked for the Alpha version last summer is out of date - don't use it.  So far I started with a fresh install, and did a 'apt-clone upgrade' which was successful.





Next step:  getting X and gnome installed correctly.





Update:  xorg installed with an error that looks OK, but gnome won't
