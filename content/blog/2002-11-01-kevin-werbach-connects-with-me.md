Kevin Werbach connects with me today:

In [ Into the Matrix ](//werbach.com/blog/2002/10/31.html#a409") he captures exactly how I feel about view that we're going to be trapped into a Matrix like situation by increasingly strict and complex software licenses.  

_ "If I were a pessimist like Larry Lessig, I'd say we're going to wake up one day and find we're living in the Matrix -- a prison built of software. But I'm an optimist. Unfortunately, I haven't yet come up with the counter-argument." _  

Same for me - I intellectually connect with Lessig but find I don't connect emotionally nearly as much.  I know it's partly an optimism thing, but worry that I'm rationalizing my lack of initiative to do something about it….
