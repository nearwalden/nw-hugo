Sometimes when people do something extraordinary in their life, it overshadows everything else they do. It's always great to be able to celebrate the life of someone like Sir Edmund Hillary who did something wonderful, and then live a life of grace and achievement which rivaled the original accomplishment.





It's also a good time to remember Tenzing Norgay, his Sherpa counterpart who has a full half-share in the claim of "first to summit Mt. Everest".
