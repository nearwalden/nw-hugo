I was tongue-in-cheek [when I originally wrote about the idea](http://blogs.sun.com/enviro/entry/carbon_redux), but[ Fiji water has made it a reality](http://www.environmentalleader.com/2007/11/07/fiji-water-to-go-carbon-negative/)!  





I'm not sure if I like their name ("carbon negative") or mine ("double carbon neutral") better.  





So, what's better for the environment - drinking "carbon negative" water that's bottled in Fiji and shipped to your store in plastic bottles, or drinking "carbon positive" tap water?  You make the call....
