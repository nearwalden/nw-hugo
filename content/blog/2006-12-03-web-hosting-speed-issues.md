_[Web Hosting Speed Issues…](http://mattheaton.com/?p=63#comments): "About three weeks ago I became obsessed with finding out every major inefficiency with our code, with Cpanel, and with Linux itself (The OS we run our hosting company on)."_





This is in a post from [Matt Heaton](http://mattheaton.com), president of [BlueHost](http:/bluehost.com), the hosting service I use for NearWalden and some other domains.  There's a gzillion hosting providers out there.  Why did I end up with BlueHost?  a) their prices were competitive, b) they had an extensive online forum, and c) their president had a blog.  So far they've been great, and based on what I've seen they'll be willing to tell me when they haven't been great, which is what I'm looking for.
