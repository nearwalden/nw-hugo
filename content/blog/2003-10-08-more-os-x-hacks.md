[More OS X Hacks](//boingboing.net/2003_10_01_archive.html#106539259184944626"). Rael Dornfest is doing a new, Panther-ready edition of Mac OS X Hacks and he's looking for your power-user tips:

And so I turn to you, gentle readers, for your interest in contributing to the next book.

Please do leave a writeback or drop me a line. While we'll certainly be covering more of Panther than you can shake a stick at, there's no reason to be OS version-specific.
