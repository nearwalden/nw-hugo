I've been playing with [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/), and its pretty cool.  What's been interesting is the size of the Sun network.  It's currently between 7% and 8% of employees (assuming the network is mostly currently employees.   But what's more interesting is how fast people are joining.  Yesterday at this time the number was 2,676, and now its at 2,695 - 19 people joined in the last 24 hours.





Since I'm using my blog to record the data, there'll be more readings to come...
