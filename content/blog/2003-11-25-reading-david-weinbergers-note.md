Reading David Weinberger's note about the Linux desktop and the "help Dave make his case" rebuttals reminded me of [this great parody](//www.ubergeek.tv/switchlinux/').  I'm very glad I learned to be useful on a Linux desktop, but I'm also glad OS X came along. [Link](//www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002204.html')
