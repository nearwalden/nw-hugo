From[ Bill Simmons on espn.com](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/0711130&sportCat=nfl):





<blockquote>What if the Pats left Chris Hanson inactive for the Jets game and played without a punter? Wouldn't that be the ultimate slap in the face? _Know this going in, Mangini ... we're not punting._ Can you think of a better psychological ploy? It's one thing to go 19-0; it's another thing to be the team that intentionally scratched their punter before a game for the first-ever Eff You Transaction. Now I know what I want for Christmas.</blockquote>
