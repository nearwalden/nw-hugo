[David Weinberger writes ](//www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/002014.html") about the interconnectedness of events and the statistics of coincidence.

This example illustrates how the wealth of readily available data on the web leads to a growing, and often false sense of the relationship between various events.  If David hadn't been able to check the web immediately, he may not have remembered to check the paper later, or may have missed an article about the Japanese earthquake.  

It's a great time to be a consiracy theorist!
