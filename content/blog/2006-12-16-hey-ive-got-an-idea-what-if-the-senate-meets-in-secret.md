[ _"Somewhere, someone got the exact wrong message."_](http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/node/1641)





The [Sunlight Foundation](http://www.sunlightfoundation.com/) has it right.  We have got to push for more transparency in government, not less.  Why don't we know where all of these ridiculous add-ons to bills come from?  Who's saying what to whom?  If you push for one thing this year, push for transparency.  I don't care if you're a D, R or something else, this topic will help all of us.
