Wired News reports that someone is being sued for discovering that the 'Shift Key' can defeat the copy protection.  I [ wrote to Industry Standard in May, 2001](//radio.weblogs.com/0111105/stories/2002/10/16/dcmaNotesALetterToIndustry.html") after exchanging emails with Lawrence Lessig and pointing out that DCMA is totally independent of the quality of the encryption technology.  In fact, the RIAA et al should stop spending money on these technologies, as they will usally be broken anyway, and they can always fall back on DCMA!
