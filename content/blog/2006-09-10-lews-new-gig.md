[Lew Tucker -- Java Pioneer and Creator of Salesforce.com's AppExchange to be CTO of Radar Networks](http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2006/08/java_pioneer_cr.html)





Cool!  Lew is a great friend and is always working on cool stuff.  Lew's one of those guys who is sometimes more in the background than maybe he should be given the level of contribution he's always making.  I'm sure that Nova and team are brewing up something interesting at [Radar Networks](http://radarnetworks.com/), and Lew will be a huge asset to them.
