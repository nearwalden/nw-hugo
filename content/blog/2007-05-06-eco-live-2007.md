Spent most of the day at [Eco Live 2007](http://rope.kgoam810.com/green/green.html).  Got to spend a couple of hours with [RFK Jr.](http://www.robertfkennedyjr.com/) this morning, then did a short speech and introduced him as the main speaker.  An honor to meet him, and personally exciting to spend some time together.  We had a little less than 1000 in the audience, but it was a great and very interactive crowd.
Mr. Kennedy talked a lot from [his latest book](http://www.amazon.com/Crimes-Against-Nature-Corporate-Plundering/dp/0060746882/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-9220282-1852950?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1178423853&sr=8-1), but added on some great comments about the role of the wilderness in religion and the role of the environment in American history.  I think both of our talks got taped somewhere, and if I find them I'll link to them here.  We talked about how to use sensors and real-time websites to start to raise awareness about the changes that are happening in the environment.  We both thought this might be a good fit for [his work with our nation's water resources](http://www.waterkeeper.org/).
We also got a [Flex Your Power](http://www.fypower.org/) award today, which was awesome!
Now at the airport for the redeye trip home - looking forward to getting there in the morning.
