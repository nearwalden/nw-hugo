A nice run under a nearly full moon on Monday night, a crisp New England fall evening.  And I was joined by an old friendâ€¦Orion the Hunter made his first full appearance (at least to me) since the spring.  





For some reason Orion has grown to have some vague significance in my life.  The passing of seasons and of time, a fellow traveler through the winter months, or some other subliminal connection.  Whatever it is, the feeling on seeing him on the run was striking and warming at the same time.
