[Roger Pielke, Jr summarizes the state of climate legislation in Australia](http://rogerpielkejr.blogspot.com/2009/08/australian-gambit.html), and speculates on what it could mean for the US.  If this is the next outcome here I would think it quite positive - strengthen the renewable energy and efficiency efforts, and drop the poorly designed cap and trade for now.
