David Isenberg has a [nice summary](//isen.com/blog/2005/01/costs-of-ftth.html") of the cost of fiber to the home (FTTH).  













"What can be said accurately and confidently is that under any reasonable estimate for construction costs and take rates, FTTH can be had for capex in the low thousands per installation.  "
