Mark Cuban (aka BlogMaverick)  [gets realistic about podcasting](//www.blogmaverick.com/entry/1234000667050432/").  





I'm going to agree on one thing.  Almost by definition, most podcasts are going to be in the long tail of podcasts, so will have almost no traffic.  If I put podcasts in with the broader set of media options, then very few may make it out of the long tail.  And, remember, long tail = no $$ for the individuals inhabiting it. (there may be a business for long tail aggregators, but not the individuals)





On the other hand, I think there are new things about podcasting, and it will open up some new forms of communications, some of which may really catch on.  I think the connection with iTunes (and hence, to the iPod) goes beyond streaming because it works in a disconnected mode, which is important in our current "partially connected" world.
