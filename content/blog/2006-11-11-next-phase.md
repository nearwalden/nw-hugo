I'm not telling anyone anything they don't know when I say we've entered a new phase in US politics.  Though I'm generally behind the Republican party on things, I'm glad this happened.  We're in complex situations, and this last Rep. leadership (incl. the President) was ill-equipped to deal with them.





If you get a chance, read [Peggy Noonan's piece](http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110009221) in the WSJ today (11/11).  This captured almost exactly how I feel right now - lets get refocussed and move forward.
