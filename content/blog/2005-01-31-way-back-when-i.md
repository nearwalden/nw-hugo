"Way back when I posted twice about marriage, I was preparing a general case about the texture of Christian marriage as a particular sacramental institution. I proposed a variety of ways of thinking about Christian marriage, noting that a strictly biblical version of Christian marriage (hence, a version defined by marriage as the New Testament represents it) begins with indissolubility, exclusive duality, constitutive gender complementarity, and the subordination of women to men. Add to that the long-standing tradition that sexual expression in marriage serves solely procreative ends, and you can get a plausible picture of 'traditional Christian marriage.'"













Thus begins  a thought provoking piece by AKMA (they usually are) on marriage.
