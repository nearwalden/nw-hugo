Just wanted to take a minute and remember my friend and colleague Phil Rosenzweig.  Phil was a long-time Sun employee and was killed five years ago today on one of the planes that left Boston.





In memory of Phil, someone else you know, or the whole event, please try to do something nice for someone today.  Go a little out of your way to hold a door open, call someone you haven't talked to for a while, or give someone you love a hug.  We need to remind ourselves and everyone else all of the things that are great about this country and the people who can make it up.
