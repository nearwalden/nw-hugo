Jonathan Schwartz's [Network Intelligence](//blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jonathan/20050117#we_will_be_simpler") does a nice job of capturing a the current state of the world for distributed data gathering and aggregation via the 'Net, blogs, cellphones, etc.  Better yet, it gives a sense of the speed of change.  













The key here is obviously the network.  It's one thing to create or capture some data or an idea, its another for it to be shared so easily.  This is why blogs and wikis are so new and different.
