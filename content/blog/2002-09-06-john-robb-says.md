[John Robb says:](//jrobb.userland.com/2002/09/05.html'): "_I have 95% of my PC's processer available at any given moment.  In a year that will probably be 98%, in three years it will be 99%.  This model of the Internet is so messed up.  The fact that over 90% of the computing horsepower on the Internet sits idle at any given moment is insane (in fact, 98% of my DSL connection is dead too)._"

Question for John:  what's the utilization of your car?  How about your microwave or toaster?  Even your TV?  

On the one hand I'm energized by the [ Ray's post ](//www.ozzie.net/blog/2002/09/04.html")and others about the potential for the PC in a new role - breaking out of client-server and into something both more personal and more powerful.  Cool!  

But even then I bet we only use 10% of our systems, so relax, John!
