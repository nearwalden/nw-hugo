[ Stephen Ambrose ](//www.stephenambrose.com/") passed away today.  I hope he is remembered for his great contribution in making important parts of American history accessible to a broad audience.  I espencially appreciated his ability to provide a voice for people who were involved.  

If you want to read more serious work by Stephen, I suggest "Americans at War", a book of short essays.  It differs from his recent books in that more of his own opinions and beliefs show through.

On a personal note, Mr. Ambrose was a friend of both of my parents who graduated from high school with him in Whitewater, Wisconsin.  Stephen and my dad were actually co-valedictorians.  I believe they last saw him in New Orleans when my folks were on one of their Civil War trips (Vicksburg, in this case).
