Wired talks about [companies banning IM in the workplace.](//www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,55090,00.html')  This seems really short sited - I think a much more thoughtful approach is to setup an internal IM system (ala [Jabber](//www.jabber.org/') or [Groove](//www.groovenetworks.com/') or something) and then look into securing bridges to the external world.  

Unless of course these companies are also blocking all email and US Postal mail, in which case they are at least being consistent!
