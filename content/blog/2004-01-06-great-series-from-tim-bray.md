Great series from Tim Bray on technological successes and failures.  








  * [Methodology](//www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/03/TPM1")




  * [Winners](//www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/03/TPSM-Winners") - a good list in my mind.  The one thing I would also add is "servers", and an emerging winner of "services".




  * [Losers](//www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/04/TPSM-Losers") - an ok list, but there's lots to choose from.  I would disagree with video on demand, it happened but was implemented as Tivo instead of how people thought.  I would have added Microsoft Bob as a representative attempt to make standard computers approachable.  This field has been a very bad failure.




  * [Finally, a proposed set of predictors](//www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/01/05/TPSM-Candidates").  This is an interesting list to contemplate.
