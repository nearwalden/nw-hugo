Kevin Werbach is noodling over the inherent value in [LinkedIn](//www.linkedin.com/') and I've been grappling with the same thing.  Every time I think I have a good use for it it doesn't quite get there.   On the other hand I keep feeling like it will, so have a mental background process watching my daily activities for uses.  

I have to admit that there's a little of the "I wouldn't join a club that would have me" kind of a feeling - if I'm just joy riding around in here, what makes me think these others aren't doing the same? 

Anyway, I'm going to keep at it for now!  [Link](//werbach.com/blog/2003/12/15.html#a1338')
