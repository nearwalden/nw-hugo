There's an increasing "get out of Iraq" drumbeat in the mainstream media and the blogs these days.  I'm no expert, but have sensed a widening gap between this rhetoric and the stories I've directly and indirectly heard from people involved with the effort.  





For anyone who cares about this, Joe Lieberman's letter to the WSJ today is a must-read (unfortunately not on-line - I'll see if I can dig up the text). He reiterates many of the points [he's been making on the Senate floor](//www.realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-11_15_05_Lieberman_pf.html")                   , but he's just come back from Iraq yet again.  It comes much closer to what I've heard of the situation.  I'm sure he's taking massive heat for this, but I give him a lot more credit for coming back and saying what he feels.  Way to go, Joe.
