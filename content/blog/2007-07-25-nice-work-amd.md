Congrats to AMD on [exceeding their initial GHG reduction goal](http://blogs.business2.com/greenwombat/2007/07/amds-ambitious-.html), and on setting another aggressive goal.  Great job!





As the article mentions, transparency is something that we believe in when it comes to environmental impact, and AMD is setting a great example.
