Hal says his Devils are [Streaking The Wrong Way](http://agrosnowman.com/snowman/?p=81#comments), but being on the other end of last night's game.  You never feel quite as good about the win when the other team's main goalie is on the bench (especially when he's a perennial killer of the Bruins), but a win is a win, and it was good to see the lads focus through the 3rd period.
