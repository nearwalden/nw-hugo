Well, I picked a tough day to have to fly from SF to LA and then on to Boston.  Lines were very long in the airport today, and in case you haven't heard, there's no liquids of any kind allowed through security or onto the planes.  





Since I'm ending up at home I decided to ditch my toothpaste and lotion and carry everything on. 





The line through security for United's Premier customers was about 20 minutes, and I heard the regular line was quite a bit longer.  However both United and the TSA had extra people on hand and things were moving right along.  I've always been impressed with the TSA crew at SFO, and today was another example of their professionalism and hard work.





Congrats to whatever team of people thwarted the terrorists in London.  I'll probably never know who you are, but you are appreciated!
