Had dinner tonight in LA with Max Schorr, Publisher and Editor in Chief of [Good Magazine](http://www.goodmagazine.com/about/).  I was coming off of a productive trip out west and he had just sent the first issue to press, so it was a lively upbeat conversation.  





I was a fairly early subscriber and am looking forward to the first issue in a few weeks (I got a sneak preview and it looks like fun).  If you're interested, your whole subscription will go to the charity of your choice (from their list of 20 or so).  All magazines need to get subscribers in order to attract advertisers, and giving the subscription fees to charity instead of sending out 2 million post cards like most new pubs do was their attempt to break from a wasteful tradition.





I'm sure we'll be crossing paths again - there was lots of philosophy in common and it was a fun meal.





Good luck, Max!
