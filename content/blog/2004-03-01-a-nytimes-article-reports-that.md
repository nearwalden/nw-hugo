[A NYTimes article](//www.nytimes.com/2004/03/01/technology/01bill.html") reports that MIT has 1/3 less computer science majors compared to a year ago.  It then goes farther to report that comp sci majors aren't even looking for comp sci jobs (though that's been happening for awhile).  Is Computer Science going the way of the Automotive Engineering Department?  I think there's some real parallels to draw…
