I see [this kind of blockchain story](https://www.axios.com/blockchain-ibm-walmart-food-trust-supply-chain-7015c1f1-2e6e-4633-b682-8f43bb43f345.html) all of the time. They imply that the missing piece to Hard Problem #14 (tracking fresh fruit, in this case) was an anonymous, distributed ledger (e.g. blockchain). Iâ€™ll just say I tend to disagree.
