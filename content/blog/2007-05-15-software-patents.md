Microsoft is bringing software patents to the forefront with [their article this week in Fortune](http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/).  My sense is that they are testing the water - if you have a reaction to this you need to tell them what you think, either directly or through your purchases.





The Sun bloggers have already produced some interesting reading on this.  [Greg P](http://blogs.sun.com/Gregp/entry/are_software_patents_useful) and [Jonathan](http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/what_we_did) are laying out Sun's position more and more clearly, and [Tim](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/05/14/Dillon-on-Patent-Trolls) provides his thoughtful-as-always commentary (follow the links to his earlier work, but the last line says it all..."Shut up or litigate").  But make sure to read [Mike Dillon](http://blogs.sun.com/dillon/entry/cautiously_optimistic), Sun's general counsel and senior most legal guy - it'll open up your eyes to what's happening.





I'm not going to tell you that this is as important as dealing with climate change, but if you run a business it is important to you, and if you run a technology-driven business, then it is critical to the future of your business.
