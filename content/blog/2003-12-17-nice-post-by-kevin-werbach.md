Nice post by Kevin Werbach summarizing some of the different approaches to VOIP.  His main point is the big one:  voice is an application, and in the right environment it isn't differentiated from other applications.  [Link](//werbach.com/blog/2003/12/14.html#a1337')

Follow-up post by Jeremy Allaire takes similar tack, but elaborates on why some of the distinctions are artificial.
