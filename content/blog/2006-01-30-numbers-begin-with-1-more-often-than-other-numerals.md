Fun [note by Cory](//www.boingboing.net/2006/01/28/numbers_begin_with_1.html") over at Boing Boing about the special status of the number 1. 








<blockquote>A mathematical theory called 'Benford's Law' predicts that in a set of numbers, numbers whose first digit is '1' will turn up more frequently than numbers that start with other digits. Benford, a GE physicist in 1938, formulated his law after discovering that GE's book of logarithm tables was substantially more worn on pages of logarithms corresponding to numbers starting with 1.
