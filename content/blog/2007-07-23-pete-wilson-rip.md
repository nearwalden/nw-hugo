In May I was one of the speakers at [Eco Live!](http://rope.kgoam810.com/green/green.html), an event we co-hosted with [KGO](http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/front) in San Francisco.  As part of the event, I did an hour of live radio with Pete Wilson, afternoon radio host at KGO.  Pete and I discovered we were both from Wisconsin, and he used that to really make me feel comfortable.





I was saddened [to hear today that Pete had passed away](http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=local&id=5499319) due to a heart attack during hip replacement surgery. Pete was a massive golf fan (it was on 4 of the 6 monitors in the studio when I was in there for his show), and we talked about him getting his hips fixed up so he could keep up his game.





I didn't spend that long with him, but he was one of those people that one hour was enough to get a sense of the person.
