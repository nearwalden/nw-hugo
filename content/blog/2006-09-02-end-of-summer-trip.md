Just wrapping up a great end-of-summer trip with the family.  My wife and I and the kids spent a week in CO, joined by my folks for a few days in the middle.  





Highlights:






  * Driving across Rocky Mountain National Park on Trail Ridge Road
  * Street performers in Boulder
  * Our stay at [the Broadmoor](http://www.broadmoor.com/) in Colorado Springs
  * Great weather and fresh air




Some fun things to do in the extended Denver area:






  * ["Tour of Tea" at Celestial Seasonings](http://www.celestialseasonings.com/whoweare/tour/index.php)
  * [Lunchtime tour at NCAR](http://www.ncar.ucar.edu/)
  * [Dinosaur footprints near Morrison](http://www.frontrangeliving.com/outdoors/DinosaurRidge.htm)
  * [US Olympic training center in Colo Springs](http://www.usoc.org/12181_19096.htm)




Three generations of us had a great time!
