Some good posts at isen.blog about the Hubbert curve and the decline of oil usage:









  * [News from the Oil Patch](//www.isen.com/blog/archives/2004_02_01_archive.html#107705751845795816")




  * [Phase Changes in Oil and Telecom](//www.isen.com/blog/archives/2004_02_01_archive.html#107757857968284912")









Lots of great analysis on this topic in Vaclav Smil's book _[Energy at a Crossroads](//www.allconsuming.net/item.cgi?id=0262194929")_.
