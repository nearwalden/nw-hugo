We just returned from two great vacations back-to-back. The first was a week at my folks’ place in northern Wisconsin. Right on a lake, there’s a ton of great stuff for the kids to do, including fishing, swimming, water skiing, etc. And the parents had a great time, too.





When we got back we took advantage of Sun’s break and did a quick trip to Montauk to Pam’s folks place. Great beach weather and a great beach. Obviously we feel so lucky to have such great places to go.





What struck me as the trip was winding down, was how easy it is to forget about global climate change, greenhouse gas, etc. Even though I was catching up on some of my environmental reading, I was spending most of every day out in beautiful environs that hadn’t changed in the decades I’d been visiting them. Skies were blue, water was as clean as I could remember, trash and litter have mostly been reduced to things I remember growing up.





In a way it was scary, as I’m someone who lives and breathes this stuff every day. I was struck by David Weinberger’s [blog post](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/mtarchive/marketing_global_warming.html) linking to a request for marketing help in getting people to come to grips with what we’re facing.





A good problem to tackle…
