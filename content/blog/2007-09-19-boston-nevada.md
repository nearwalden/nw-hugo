[Our governor has decided](http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/09/18/governor_predicts_a_jackpot/) that either a) we dramatically raise taxes, or b) we open the state to casinos.  Argh.





Part of this is driven by the large number of Mass residents who visit the Connecticut casinos.  Part of it, I suspect, is the big success of [the Mass Lottery](http://www.masslottery.com/), which distributes over $761M a year back to communities.





I suppose I should be happy - I won't go to the casinos so others will take care of any tax increase I might have had to deal with.  On the other hand, I don't buy into the concept that these are the only two choices.
