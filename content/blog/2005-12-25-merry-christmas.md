Merry Christmas to all of you who celebrate it, and hopefully the rest of you will get to enjoy a day off or two with some friends and family. BEA has next week off, so I'm looking forward to a break after a busy fall.





Christmas Eve always makes me think of my grandparents, whose house we visited for Christmas Eve dinner every year I was growing up. Although it was only 20 minutes away, at the time it was always a big adventure to drive through the Wisconsin countryside and get there for the mayhem of all of the aunts, uncles and cousins on my Dad's side of the family. Unfortunately Grandma passed away this year, but I'm sure she's in a happy place where she can enjoy those fond memories as well.
