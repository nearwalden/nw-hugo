Right now I'm running two blogs - one on Radio (this one) and a personal one on MovableType.  Basically, my problem is that my main desktop at home is a Linux system, so I can't run Radio on it, so it's on my Mac laptop.  

Having it on the laptop is great when I'm travelling, but it's not great when I'm at home since I'm usually on my Linux desktop with the full screen, etc.  

There's lots of discussion lately about these powerful, personalized destkop apps, but it seems like there's some things to work through when I have more than one desktop.  Of course it's not that much different than the case of a server and multiple desktops, there's some sync and connectivity issues, and the big issue of managing the critical state appropriately (e.g. backups).  

I really want to make a full switch to Radio, but need to think through what it means to have everything flow through my laptop (obviously I could buy a new Mac desktop, but that's not high on my priorities right now).

Thoughts, anyone?
