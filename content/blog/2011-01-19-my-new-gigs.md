It's been almost a year since the Oracle deal closed, and I've been fortunate to work on a lot of interesting projects since then, including the [Energy Innovation Tracker](http://www.energyinnovation.us), which I'll write more about soon.





By last fall I was feeling like it was time to settle down somewhere again.  I talked to a number of companies; some of the companies were really small, and some were really large.  But late in the year I got an offer to work full-time for [Applied Minds](http://www.appliedminds.com) and their spinoff, [TouchTable](http://www.touchtable.com), and enthusiastically accepted.





For the rest of this post I'll just answer some of the obvious questions.





_Why Applied Minds and TouchTable?_





There were two things that attracted me.  The first was innovation.  I thought a lot over the summer whether I should go be a senior exec somewhere, or I wanted to stay closer to the innovation.  I also considered whether I wanted to focus on one thing (like you do at a startup), or have a broader scope.





This job hit the answer to both questions.  I still feel like I can innovate, and that there's some important problems and some potentially lucrative problems around that deserve some attention.  But, at the same time, I had a hard time committing to a single problem.  AMI and TouchTable offered up a combination of both.





The second thing that attracted me was the opportunity to work with Danny Hillis again.  We'd worked closely at Thinking Machines for almost a decade, had stayed in touch since, and I always wanted to work closely with again.





_Are you moving to LA?_





Nope, we're staying in Concord, MA.  I'll be out here regularly, but also expect to help both companies out in DC, which is an easy trip for me.  I started work on a home office over the summer, and am putting together plans to finish that off now that I know what I'm doing.





_Are you going to be working on sustainability?_





This is the most frequent question I got over the past year, and my answer has consistently been "I'm always working on sustainability".





I did look at some CSO type jobs, but I'll tell you that they are few and far between.  I recently told someone that I bet there are fewer full-time corporate sustainability professionals than there are NBA players, and last I checked that was a pretty tough gig to get.





But as we said at Sun, "every job is an eco job".  So I plan on bringing an eco mindset to everything I do, but also am confident there will be some opportunities at AMI to work directly on some eco problems.  Furthermore, I'll still be involved with activities outside of work such as [EIT](http://www.energyinnovation.us) and [NEON](http://www.neoninc.org).





I'll send more details as I settle in, but having fun so far!
