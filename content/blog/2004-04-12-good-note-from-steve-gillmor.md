Good note from Steve Gillmor about what the Sun-Microsoft detente means.  I also agree that it's a win-win, but don't look for them to buddy up.  Scott understands what it means to own and control critical IP and technology, and he's not going to let himself get caught in a situation like HP's software and chip strategy.
