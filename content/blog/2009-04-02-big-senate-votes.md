Two pretty amazing votes in the Senate yesterday which will have a major impact on any future cap and trade proposal.





The first was an 89-8 vote on an amendment on the Budget Resolution introduced by Senator John Thune (R-SD) that states that any climate change legislation cannot increase gasoline or electricity prices.  Pretty much cuts out the heart of any proposed cap and trade system.  Roger Pielke Jr. provides more insight [here](http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/prometheus/the-thune-amendment-5096).





This was followed by a second vote of 98-0 on a second amendment to the Budget Resolution.  This one, from Senator Ensign (R-NV), states that climate change legislation, be it cap and trade or carbon tax, can't increase the net tax burden of the middle class.  Again, details from Roger Pielke Jr [here](http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/prometheus/the-ensign-amendment-5098).





It's hard to read these without thinking that the possibility of real, effective, federal climate change policy just got a lot less likely.
