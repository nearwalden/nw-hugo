Many thanks to Dave Winer for [his session at Harvard tonight.](//www.corante.com/copyfight/20030201.shtml#21123')  I was amused - it was like a living blog, complete with talkback.  The one thing that translates awful to the real world is links ('h' 'h' 't' 'p' 'colon' 'slash'…..).  We need to invent a way to exchange links among wired humans in an interactive meeting.  Maybe some future version of how you exchange business cards beaming between Palm Pilots or something.
