I walked out of a restaurant tonight in SF and fireworks filled the sky. Barry Bonds had hit the home run that put him past Hank Aaron.





Having seen Hank play as a child in Milwaukee, obviously I have a soft spot for him. However, it's still sad to see the record get broken this way. Barry Bonds is not playing today without the help of steroids. Yep, he had to work hard for a long time. Yep, he's always been a great hitter. Yep, he had to show up to work everyday well into his 40's to pull it off. But he didn't do it cleanly.





I find the hardest part being how to explain the situation to my son. It is what it is, I guess, hopefully I'll see someone break the record fair and square and can be happier for them.
