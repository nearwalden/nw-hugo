Doc Searls wants an [oPhone](http://doc.weblogs.com/2007/01/15#ophone): _"Backlash by the customersphere, the journalsphere and the developersphere to news that the iPhone is closed is a huge gift to the iPhone's many new competitors. The market points to a clear and wide opening both for product differentiation and for giving customers what they want.





"Which is an open phone."_





That's exactly what I want.  And I want an oCar while you're at it (I've been calling it the Gnumobile for awhile, but whatever).





Imagine how much innovation would go on in cars if they opened up the electronics that aren't safety related.  An open processor architecture, storage, open connectors, and some open OS.  Add some speakers, a screen and a little keypad.  Then hook in a bunch of sensor data from the vehicle (distance, etc).  We can take it from there, thank you very much.
