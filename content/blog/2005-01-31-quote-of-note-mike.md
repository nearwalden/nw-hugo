[Quote of Note: Mike Stagg](//isen.com/blog/2005/01/quote-of-note-mike-stagg.html"): ""Whoever builds a fiber to the home network is going to have a monopoly - whoever builds it. As a practical matter, I am opposed to monopolies.  But I would much rather have a monopoly that I can touch and see and feel and affect, which is [Lafayette, Louisiana municipal utility operator] LUS."
Mike Stagg, co-perpetrator of the Lafayette Pro-fiber blog, quoted here."
