CNN says that reporters have found a [ Iraq-al Qaeda link](//www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/04/26/sprj.irq.britain.iraq.ap/index.html').  Interesting that this is coming from journalists who've gotten ahold of documents, not from US officials.  

Separately the article reports that France was feeding details of it's discussions with the US back to Iraq.
