In my trip to Europe last week I was struck by the ease at which you can get around with only English as a language. With the EU increasing the traffic among the countries, English seems to have taken on a stronger role as the default language for interactions among folks who aren't from the same country. This was especially true in the political melting pot of Brussels, where everyone you meet is from somewhere different.





Juxtapose this against the US, where the dominance of English is on the decline. The rise of Spanish as a true second language seems to have opened the door for a wider array of languages to get a stronger foothold as immigrants settle into various specific areas.





Question: which of the following cities has a higher percentage of billboards in English -- Berlin or San Antonio?
