Just discovered that the [Douglas Fir was actually named after a guy named David Douglas](http://www.stumpranchonline.com/skagitjournal/Washington/Library/MuirFir.html)!  Cool history and link to the history of the Sierra Club, whose [magazine I'm featured in this month](http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/200703/innovators.asp).





(I don't, however, envy his death, other than the Hawaii part)
