The Senate version of Emergency Bailout bill is now 451 pages, up from the 113 page House version that was defeated earlier in the week, which was up from the original 2 and a half page proposal.  All of the extra stuff is pork.  ([here's one of the many descriptions on the internet](http://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2008/10/senate-bailout.html)).





Is anyone paying any attention?
