The [Green Grid](http://www.thegreengrid.org/) has cool new tools and maps for datacenter efficiency:






  * Fresh air cooling map of North America (shown above)
  * Water side cooling map of North America
  * Free cooling calculation tool




The image above is a snapshot of the fresh air cooling map





All of them are [here](http://www.thegreengrid.org/library-and-tools.aspx). Green Grid members have access to the higher res versions. Great job, Green Grid!
