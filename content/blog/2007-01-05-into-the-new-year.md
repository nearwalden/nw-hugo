I took a little break from blogging over the holidays, but am back in the saddle again.






The flurry of press and activity at the end of 2006 continued straight through the holidays.  If the number of eco conferences in 2007 is a leading indicator, attention to datacenter power will continue to grow as a topic through the new year.  Here's a few tidbits from over the holidays:



  * _[Project Blackbox](http://www.sun.com/emrkt/blackbox/index.jsp)...relentless._  The last two calls I did prior to breaking away with my family for XMAS were on Project Blackbox.  Oh, and then I did one more even after I'd officially left.  I'm still accepting bets for those of you who think this thing won't ever make it into the mainstream.
  * _[EPA announces plans for Energy Star for servers.](http://news.com.com/Energy+Star+for+efficient+servers/2100-1010_3-6146327.html)_  Energy Star is a wildly successful program, and we're excited to see it expanded into the server space.
  * _Customers are taking notice._  [Interest in our energy efficient Niagara servers continues to rise.](http://news.com.com/2061-10808_3-6146127.html)  And keep an eye on the press, because [we're starting to talk more about Niagara 2.](http://news.com.com/Suns+Niagara+2+doubles+down+with+twice+the+threads/2100-1006_3-6108880.html)  






We're hitting the new year running.  We made a dent in datacenter power in 2006, and we've think we can take it a lot farther in 2007.  Quoting the motto [of my home state](http://www.wisconsin.gov/state/core/wisconsin_state_symbols.html):  Forward!
