The shuttle investigation  [ "will include a review by an independent board led by retired Navy Adm. Harold Gehman, who headed the probe of the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole in Yemen."](//www.cnn.com/2003/US/02/02/shuttle.investigation/index.html"). 

I wonder if anyone will emerge from this investigation like Richard Feynman did in the independent review following the Challenger tragedy.  It seems like NASA is being much more open this time, which would lessen the chance that someone would walk in from outside and basically show everyone that they weren't being very intellectually honest about the range of possibile causes.
