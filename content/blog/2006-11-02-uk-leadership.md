If you're at all interested in climate change and its possible effects on the world, then spend some time reviewing the findings of the [_Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change_](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/sternreview_index.cfm) issued by Sir Nicholas Stern, The UK's Head of the Government Economics Service and Adviser to the Government.





The [presentation](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/987/6B/Slides_for_Launch.pdf) and [speaking notes](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/media/99D/3D/sternreview_speakingnotes.pdf) are easy places to start, but at least take a look through the [table of contents](http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/independent_reviews/stern_review_economics_climate_change/stern_review_report.cfm) of the 600 page report and get an idea of the scope and depth of what's presented here.





Even though they only account for 2% of global green house gas emissions, the United Kingdom and its government have made a strong statement with this report. Based on my visits and discussions with people there I know they are tuned into this issue way beyond most other locales. This report signifies their intention to take a global leadership role on this issue, and given this report I think many will find it a welcome one.
