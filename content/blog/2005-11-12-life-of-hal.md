I always enjoy [my friend Hal's blog](//blogs.sun.com/roller/page/stern").  We overlapped during my whole time at Sun (he's still there as CTO of the Software biz) and his posts capture the essence of life as a traveling tech exec with a family and a love of sports.  Somehow his posts fill in for the big gaps between dinners together (which are always in the bay area, even though he lives in NJ and me in MA).  His latest [story](//blogs.sun.com/roller/page/stern?entry=beauty_and_the_geek") about his seat mate on a flight from France is classic Hal.
