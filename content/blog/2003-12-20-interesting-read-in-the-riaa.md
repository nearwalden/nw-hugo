Interesting read in the RIAA v. Verizon case that was just decided on in favor of Verizon.  I thought the judges were pretty direct in their decision against RIAA, but in the end were stated to be "sympathetic" to their cause.  Thanks to [Lessig](//www.lessig.org/blog/archives/001643.shtml') for the link.  [ Link ](//pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200312/03-7015a.pdf')
