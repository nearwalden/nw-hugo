The Wall Street Journal has a very nice piece on Falling Water, Frank Lloyd Wright’s signature house in Pennsylvania. It’s one of those buildings that is hard to put into words, but Ada Louise Huxtable does does an elegant job suitable for the subject matter.  

Interestingly, she and her husband got to stay in the house with the original owner before he passed away - a rare treat indeed.





I saw Falling Water about 20 years ago, and its one of those places that stays with you no matter how long its been since you’ve seen it. If you are ever in PA in a car, make the effort.
