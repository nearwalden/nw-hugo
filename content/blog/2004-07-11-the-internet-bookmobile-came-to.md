The Internet Bookmobile came to Walden Pond and learned first hand
about the conflicting goals for that property. What would Thoreau think?









__









_Yesterday
(July 8, 2004) I took the Internet Bookmobile to Walden Pond in
Concord, Mass. It was the 150th anniversary of H. D. Thoreau's boo k
"Walden." The Thoreau Society had a dawn to dusk reading.

_After an hour of having readers print and take away free copies of "Walden,"  
I was asked by the Walden Pond Reservation police to pack up and leave  
and threatened with arrest. I left.  

_









_The park supervisor (Denise Morrissey, 978-369-3254) told me I could  
not pass out free literature without a permit. And she would not give me  
a permit because, as she explained, the state park gets money from a  
concession by the Thoreau Society, which operates a store that sells  
"Walden"-and I was competing with them by giving away free copies.  

_









_There is no place to park at Walden Pond except in the state parking  
lot, for which I paid $5.
