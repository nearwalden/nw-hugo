Well, the Bruins finally got bad enough that they had to do something big, and trading your premier player and captain certainly is big.









At this point they've got less points than the Columbus BlueJackets (yes, they are a professional hockey team). They have less points than the Nashville Predators. And they're no where near as tough, prideful or anything else as their ads suggest.









As Barry Melrose [said today ](//sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=melrose_barry&id=2243041")on ESPN "Things can only get better for these two teams. They can't get much worse."
