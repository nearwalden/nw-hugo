Clay Shirky's post about the whether social software has been bad for the Dean campaign reinforces my model of what's happened:  People are in love with Dean the Campaign, but not necessarily in love with Dean the Candidate.  This is compounded by the fact that people post their opinions on Dean sites and start to believe that their opinions ARE the Dean opinions, when in fact the candidate is what he is.
