Great [Bill Simmons piece](http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/060620) from yesterday.  I wonder what his reaction will be about that amazing moment where, late in game 6 Dwayne Wade dribbles the ball right at Dirk, throws a big elbow at him, and the refs send him to the line?





Amazing game, Dwayne, but you got some help on that one.
