[Hal captured exactly what I was thinking](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/stern?entry=blogging_and_the_nba_finals) when I was watching the Mavs-Suns game last night. Other than a vague interest in the local team, I haven’t really followed the NBA much for a long time. But somehow I find the Mavs compelling.





I always get the impression that the formal NBA hates Mark Cuban, but I think he’s the best thing to happen to the game in ages. Who else will publish stats on officials in a tasteful way? Who else is willing to tell the truth?





I’m also becoming a big Avery Johnson fan. It’s clearly his team, but he doesn’t have to making sure you know it all of the time.





Go Mavs!
