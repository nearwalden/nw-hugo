I'm just catching up on some old links and found [this travel post by James Gosling](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/jag?entry=improbable_engineering).  These boats are very cool.  A friend and I rented one for 1/2 day and it took us all over the place.  You can't believe how people can live on top of one another and then on top of the river and canals.





As James says, the boats are works of fundamental ingenuity, making use of readily available parts in ways we'd never think of in the US.  I have to say that in the whole trip I never felt ill-at-ease or in danger - they are very steady.
