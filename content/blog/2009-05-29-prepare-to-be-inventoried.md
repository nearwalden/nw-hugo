In our eco team at Sun we are faced with a wave of new external environmental reporting, monitoring, and measurement requirements.  We're big on transparency, but the costs and implied morality are getting to be a drag.





One example.  Everyone wanted a price on carbon so that it was built into the economy.  But even though that appears to be on the way, its now not enough.  Now there are folks who want us to report details on the GHG emissions of every aspect of our business, including some who want us to report the complete carbon footprint of each product through the entire supply chain.  Is there any use for this data other than for people to give us grades on how "good" we are?  Not clear.





Well, Nancy Pelosi finally identified the end point of this trend.  Yesterday in an environmental speech in China she said:  _"Every aspect of our lives must be subjected to inventory."_
