This probably won't be a regular feature, but I often find things to get my mind going when I read [Tim Bray's ongoing](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/).





This week [Tim talks about business blogging:](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/03/31/Scoble-in-March)





"If your employees are going to say stupid things in public, you've got a management problem and a policy problem, not a blogging problem."
