'Internet Security Model debunked' is a very interesting read about the inherent threat model of the Internet.  While I think it's useful to consider if it a reasonable security model given how the web world generally works, I'm much more interested in observing how people misuse SSL as the magic solution to all networking security problems.  Too many people are taking the approach that if it's traffic on the Internet, then SSL must be the right answer.  Worse yet, too many people are playing along.
