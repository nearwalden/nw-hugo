Facts from ["Let My People Go Surfing"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594200726/sr=8-1/qid=1142692566/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-0184145-0020041?%5Fencoding=UTF8) by Patagonia CEO founder Yvon Chouinard:






  * from raw materials it costs 110,000 BTUs to make a Patgonia shirt
  * shipping it airfreight from Ventura, CA to a store in Boston costs 50,000 BTUs




And generically, cost to ship per ton:






  * Rail or boat:  400 BTUs per ton per mile
  * Truck:  3,300 BTUs per ton per mile
  * Air cargo:  21,760 BTUs per ton per mile




If you're buying over the internet and have time to spare - ship it ground!
