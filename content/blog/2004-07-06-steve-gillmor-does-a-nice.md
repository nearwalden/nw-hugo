Steve Gillmor does a [nice review](//blog.ziffdavis.com/gillmor/archive/2004/07/02/1399.aspx") of the Java debate at the end of Java One.  Gingell and Gosling are way up there when I think of people who are both smart and thoughtful - nice to see them getting their points across so well in a setting like this.
