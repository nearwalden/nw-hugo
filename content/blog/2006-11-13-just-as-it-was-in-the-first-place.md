[Just as it was in the first place](http://doc.weblogs.com/2006/11/11#justAsItWasInTheFirstPlace): "Most of all, we need to recognize that 11/7 was Independence Day for citizens, not just a victory for the Democrats in Conres. The Republicans took a 'thumpin' indeed; but they took it from voters expressing their independence. As the new majority party, Democrats need to recognize that, or they'll get thumped too, next time around."
