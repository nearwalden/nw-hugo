This week our company, [ConnecTerra](//www.connecterra.com/") was purchased by [BEA Systems.](//www.bea.com/")   Overall, this is a great landing place for our products, technology and expertise.  Every day this week has been new discoveries about how deep the alignment of vision and philosophy has is.





As one of the founders of ConnecTerra I can say that I'm immensely proud of the team, and am happy that we found such a good fit.  There is lots of life in the RFID business, though it is going to continue to take some investment to capitalize on the momentum.  On top of that, we were increasingly facing questions of company size, ability to provide worldwide support, etc, as we began to compete with larger companies such as IBM and Oracle.  It feels like the right time to transition the core technology into a company that can deliver on these emerging requirements.  





Onward!
