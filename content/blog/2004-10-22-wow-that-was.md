Wow - that was a great win and a great series.  As many have said, I think the Red Sox exorcised a number of demons in that series, and the omnipotence of the Yankees wore off a little more.  Just last year they were losing the World Series to a team with a fraction of their salary in Florida.

I also give credit to the Patriots, for they've been fundamental in the feeling of sports optimism that pervades the Bay State.
