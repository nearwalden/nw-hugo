AKMA with very cool old Bible that uses pictures in place of key words:
_






In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, one poular mode of biblical instruction invovled the Hieroglyphical Bible or the Bible in Pictures, a sort of rebus-like affair wherein pictures stand in for some of the words. For instance, in this example (from well-known printer Isaiah Thomas's _A Curious Hieroglyphick Bible, or, Select Passages in the Old and New Testaments, Represented with Emblematical Figures, for the Amusement of Youth_) shown in the Library of Congress, the author has substituted a haloed Hebrew Tetragrammaton for the English 'God,' an odd cloudy shape for 'heavens,' a globe for 'earth,' and so on. This dovetails exquisitely with Magritte's observation that 'An image can take the place of a word in a proposition' (in the seventh proposition in 'Words and Images').
