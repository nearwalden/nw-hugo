Today Sun took an important step forward in transparency and reporting by posting an update to our [2008 CSR Report](http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/csr/report2008/index.js). We've posted this mid-year update for two reasons:






  1. We want to make sure we were holding ourselves accountable throughout the (reporting) year - not just during the report process at the end of the year. Over the long term we would like to move toward a reporting model where we publish timely data throughout the year rather than just once a year in a neatly packaged report.  By definition, some of the data is stale by then.

  2. We're trying to sharpen our internal processes around data collection and progress measurement.  With some of the CSR reporting being new in the company, if you only do it once a year its easy to talk yourself into not automating the collection and reporting process.  We think in the end we can report some data more often AND at lower cost.




As far as our performance to date, I think it's fair to say we are about where we expected to be at this point in our fiscal year. There is some important data missing, data we couldn't easily uncover in time to publish a relevant update (proving the point that we have some work to do). But overall, we feel good that we are on track to meet the commitments we set for ourselves, and in some cases, surpass them.





I encourage you to read about our progress and give us your feedback by using the comments feature within the report. Providing a mid-year report and accepting in-line comments are two of the innovative features that [Marcy Lynn, our CSR Director](http://blogs.sun.com/csr/) has come up with to make the report more useful and impactful - let us know what you think.
