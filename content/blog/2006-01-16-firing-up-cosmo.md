Fired up [Cosmo](//wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Projects/CosmoHome") for the first time tonight.  Worked pretty well with iCal, though iCal won't seem to sync with it (can only publish to it, or read it as a read-only calendar).  Haven't tried [Chandler](//wiki.osafoundation.org/bin/view/Projects/ChandlerHome"), which is supposed to sync.





Would like to get a shared calendar system at homeâ€¦
