Kevin Werbach's "Mythologies of Control" post (with content from Ed Felten) brings up an idea that I've believed for a long time.  Even if an overzealous content control system determined to lock down the current internet, the capital 'I' Internet would spring up again in a different form.  It might not be the thing you dial up through your ISP to get to, it might not be one that you can get to through a legally configured Windows system, and it might not be accessible through your cable system.  In fact, it might be that alot of people can't even get to it.  But I'm positive it would come back into being.  [Link](//werbach.com/blog/2003/12/16.html#a1340')
