[These](//www.eff.org/deeplinks/archives/004077.php") are very important cases related to RFID privacy law.  As I've said here before, the RFID privacy we should be paying attention to aren't related to the tags that Wal-Mart wants on the cases and pallets they receive, and that we as consumers rarely interact with today.  Instead we should be focused on the RFID devices that we do use regularly today, namely our cell phones and the toll transponders in our cars.  





In all cases the need is the same:  restrictions on who has access to the data that is generated as we move around with these RFID devices, and what it can be used for.  These cell phone cases look to be important cornerstones for a broader set of case law related to this important new area.
