Picked a heckuva day to travel, but other than having to throw away my toothpaste and hand cream this morning, it hasn't been too bad. 





Tonight I decided that I better get to the airport early, since there's lots of redeyes out of LA and the security lines can be long under normal circumstances.  So I was a good traveller and get to the airport early so I wouldn't have to worry about missing my flight.  





I walked into Terminal 7 2 hours and 10 minutes prior to my scheduled departure.  





I walked up to my gate 2 hours and 5 minutes prior to my scheduled departure.





Five minutes through security.  Go figure.
