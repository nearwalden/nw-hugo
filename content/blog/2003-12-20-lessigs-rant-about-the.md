Lessig's rant about the lack of wireless at WSIS includes a mention that in spite of the lack of decent Internet access, they somehow had the resources to give everyone an RFID-enabled badge and monitor them through the conference.  

This is such as stupid misuse of technology.  Did these people think they were being cool?  Why take one of the most obviously unattractive uses of a technology and force it on everyone?   I doubt that people at battery conferences put a good strong on in your badge and shock you every once in awhile, but that's effectively what these people have done.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.
