[DaveNet : The 2004 Election](//davenet.userland.com/2003/08/11/the2004Election'):  Dave Winer has his next cause, and it's a very good one, both from the potential benefit and the match with the technologies that Dave generally brings to bear.  It's also a testament to the Berkman - it's a bet that someone like Dave will find the next thing that will justify their 'investment', but in this case I believe the bet may be paying off.
