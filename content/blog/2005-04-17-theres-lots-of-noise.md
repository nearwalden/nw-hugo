There's lots of noise on the wires about Sun's choice of CDDL (a Mozilla-style license).  Simon Phipps [dissects](//blogs.sun.com/roller/page/webmink/20050415) the arguments and ends with a nice summary of three main classes of license.  













If you're looking at open sourcing code, this post is a must read.  If you hate Sun, don't bother to read it.
