Just catching up on weblogs.  Thought this was another good post on the Dean situation from Clay Shirky.  I also like Kevin Werbach's comment:  'â€¦we've seen the last Internet campaign, but not the first  Internet President.' [Shirky Link](//www.corante.com/many/archives/2004/02/14/dean_and_the_last_internet_campaign.php'), [Werbach Link](//werbach.com/blog/2004/02/15.html#a1398')
