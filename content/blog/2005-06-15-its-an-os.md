Congrats to Sun on the birth of [Open Solaris](//www.opensolaris.org/os/").  It's been under way in different forms of concept and reality since I was there earlier in the decade.  





With this event I hope that Sun folks remember [Rob Gingell's](//www.cassatt.com/about/team.htm") contribution to this effort.  He was one of the first people to stand up and get people to understand that the act of open sourcing is, by definition, about last year's software, and innovation and value creation are about next year's software.
