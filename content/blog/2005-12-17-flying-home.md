Flying over the midwest on a beautiful day.' The white snow is spectacular across the plains. Missing the kids, looking forward to getting home.




'




Mark Jenkins in the January '06 [Outside Magazine](//www.outsideonline.com/"):' "The truth is, if your kids don't change your life, you -- and they -- are completely missing out.' If you choose to bring them into the world, children are the biggest adventure there is.'' You can only hope that you can find the strength and courage and grit and love to live up to the adventure."
