Being a general sports fan is nice because there's always interesting stuff going on somewhere.   For some reason, this week is really hopping:






  * Baseball is back underway, and the [Yankess are coming up north for a series at Fenway](//sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?id=2106975").  Schilling is going to be in the bullpen for the first time, adding to the usual tension and excitement of the biggest rivalry in baseball (all of sports?).
  * Tiger is tearing up the course in St. Andrews, and the Golden Bear is playing in his last major.  Definitely golf's greatest venue.
  * Michelle Wie is on a history making march through the [Men's US Amateur tournament](//www.usapl.org/").  She got through the qualifying tournament which put her into the 64-player match play contest.  Yesterday she one once and twice today, leaving her in the round of 8.  What's amazing isn't only that a woman is doing this, is that  a 15 year-old is doing it.  I don't think there's anyone else under the age of 20, man or woman, involved in this tournament.  The prize at the end is huge - an invite to the 2006 Masters.  
  * Very few of us may care, but the NHL is back on for the 2005-6 season.  Lace 'em up, boys!
  * And the biggest story, Lance Armstrong on his quest for his seventh [Tour de France](//www.letour.fr/") victory.  If you have cable, make sure to tune into OLN every night - it's history in the making, and possibly the crowning achievement of a great American hero.
