[Today's headline](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081217/af_opec_meeting.html) says that OPEC is likely cutting oil production by 2 million barrels/day.  Doing the math, that equates to 740K metric tons of CO2e per day, or 270M tons per year.  





You can pretty much read the news of the economic slowdown and see the signs of an economy-driven tail-off in global GHG emissions.  Obviously we'd all much rather see the reductions coming from efficiency and greener energy, but I'm sure the atmosphere isn't complaining.  





Now's the time to make changes - if we can get good practices in place, then maybe we can drive the emissions down from here instead of having to go back up to the previous highs and starting from there.
