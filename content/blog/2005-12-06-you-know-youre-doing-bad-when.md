If you're playing on Monday Night Football and Al Michaels and John Madden are heaping praise on you, you're in big trouble. Tonight is the same as many of the recent blow-outs. We've heard about how great Mike McMahon, QB for the Eagles can run, how good his arm is, how good his decision process is. At this point their down 14 points and haven't been able to move the ball at all.









Update: McMahon was just intercepted for a touchdown for the second time in the last 1/2 hour. 21-0 Seahawks.
