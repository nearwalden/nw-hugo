"[BusinessWeek Online](http://www.businessweek.com/careers/workingparents/blog/archives/2006/04/no_margin_for_e.html?campaign_id=rss_blog_blogspotting): 'One of the hardest things about being a working parent is that, quite often, it feels as if there's just no margin for error.'





Amen to that."
