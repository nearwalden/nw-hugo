_Leavin' Texas, fourth day of July,  

Sun so hot, the clouds so low, the eagles filled the sky.  

Catch the Detroit Lightnin' out of Sante Fe,  

The Great Northern out of Cheyenne, from sea to shining sea.  

_





Hope everyone's getting some downtime this week.  If you get some spare time, think of what you can do to make our country better.
