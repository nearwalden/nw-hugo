Interesting note by Jonathan Schwartz from Sun:  [Open source versus open standards](//rss.com.com/2010-1071-995823.html?type=pt&part=rss&tag=feed&subj=news') and a thoughtful [ response ](//blogs.law.harvard.edu/2003/04/08#a223') from Dave Winer.  

From a small software vendor point of view I agree with Dave, but having been on the Sun side, agree with Jonathan's model in that context.  If all big companies took that approach, I believe we'd have a healthier software industry.
