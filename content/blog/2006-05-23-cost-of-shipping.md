Some stats on the cost of shipping to get the juices flowing.  These are from the book ["Let My People Go Surfing"](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594200726/sr=8-1/qid=1142692566/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-0184145-0020041?%5Fencoding=UTF8) by Yvon Chouinard, founder of Patagonia and a personal hero.
_"From raw materials it costs 110,000 BTUs to make a Patgonia shirt.  Shipping it airfreight from Ventura, CA to a store in Boston costs 50,000 BTUs."_
And generically, cost to ship per ton:
_Rail or boat: 400 BTUs per ton per mile
Truck: 3,300 BTUs per ton per mile
Air cargo: 21,760 BTUs per ton per mile
_
So, whenever you can, take advantage of cheaper shipping methods.  You'll save some money and do something for the environment as well!
