One random thought on Earth Day (US version):  I think we need a second one that falls on work day.  I believe that over the next few years we're going to find that, for many people, the biggest environmental impact they can have is related what happens at work, not at home.  It's just a hunch, but in this consumer and service driven economy, I bet I'll be proven right.
