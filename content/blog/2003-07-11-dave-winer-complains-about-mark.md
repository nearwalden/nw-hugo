Dave Winer [complains about Mark Pilgrim](//scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/07/10#theFullMarkPilgrimExperience') and his aggregator which is tracking edits to scripting.com.  Dave thinks he might have a copyright argument, but there seems to be a strong parallel to Brewster and archive.org.  On the other hand, Brewster will remove you if you ask, which doesn't appear to be the case here.
