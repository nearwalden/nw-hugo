[This](//www.buzzflash.com/contributors/03/02/28_moyers.html') is what has me really annoyed lately.  Bill Moyers isn't wearing the flag because he's for America, he's supporting our troops, or because he's in favor of anything.  He's wearing the flag because he's against the President.  Too many people's expression of their patriotism is to excercise their right to free speech and tell us all what's wrong - too few of these people are doing something constructive to try to make things better.
