[This article](//www.nytimes.com/2004/11/06/opinion/06brooks.html?ex=1257483600&en=b4613533d9a1bdde&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland") by David Brooks in the Times makes a lot of sense to me.

Amazing fact from this article:  "The reality is that this was a broad victory for the president. Bush did better this year than he did in 2000 in 45 out of the 50 states.  He did better in New York, Connecticut and, amazingly, Massachusetts."
