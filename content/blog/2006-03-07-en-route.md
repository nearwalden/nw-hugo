Sitting in CDG airport in Paris en route to Prague.  Long layover - fortunately was able to talk my way into the Air France lounge where I found WiFi via TMobile and power.





CDG gets bigger and more difficult to deal with every time I come here.  The terminal two complex is amazing in scope.  After we landed we drove in a bus for 10 minutes to get to Terminal 2C, followed by 10 minute ride to get to 2B.  Both were jam packed with people.





Note:  it's now snowing like crazy at the airportâ€¦
