    Picture a bright blue ball, just spinning, spinning free,
    Dizzy with eternity.
    Paint it with a skin of sky,
    Brush in some clouds and sea,
    Call it home for you and me.
    A peaceful place or so it looks from space,
    A closer look reveals the human race.
    Full of hope, full of grace
    Is the human face,
    But afraid we may lay our home to waste.

_Throwing Stones_, lyrics by John Perry Barlow and Bob Wier





  






Two weeks ago I spoke at the [TTI/Vanguard " Global Threats...Global Opportunities" conference](http://www.ttivanguard.com/conference/2007/washingtondc.html) in Washington DC.  An eclectic set of topics, with very interesting speakers.





Two personal highlights for me were getting to see [James Lovelock](http://www.ecolo.org/lovelock/) present in person, and having [John Perry Barlow](http://homes.eff.org/~barlow/) call my talk "inspirational".
