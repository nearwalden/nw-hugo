Lots of action at [Digital ID World](http://www.digitalidworld.com/') today ([Denise](//bgbg.blogspot.com/2002_10_06_bgbg_archive.html#85545153') has some good coverage).  

All of the focus right now is on the ID of people.  This is a piece of the puzzle, but we need to figure out how devices fit into the picture as well.  I certainly want to have certain properties in my relationship with devices I get data from or control the overall environment through.  More to come on this, I bet it's going to be a bigger topic at this conference next year.
