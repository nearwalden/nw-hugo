I'm moving my site from Radio to Pebble, and also from the community server onto my own server.  Radio has been great, but work on it has slowed down and I wanted to get more control over the website.  





I'm also going to transition over to MarsEdit, and expect the tools combination to allow me to post more often, but we'll see.





One thing I've got to do is figure out what to do with my old posts.  In particular, can I import them from Radio into Pebble in such a way that the dates stay intact.  I'm sure there's a way to do it - will write a note here when I figure it out.
