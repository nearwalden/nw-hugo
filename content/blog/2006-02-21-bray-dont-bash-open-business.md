Tim Bray [has a great piece](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/02/19/Open-Discussion) on XM Radio and the fact that their board debate about the future business direction has been done more in the open than usual.  His key points are right on the money:






  * Why are we surprised that they're having a profit v. volume argument at their board level?  Isn't that what they should be doing?
  * Why are we bashing them for making parts of that discussion public?  Isn't that what we'd like to see?




It's interesting that we're so used to closed, effectively "un-American" businesses that when we see an open one, we freak out.
