Hal's got [his new hockey blog](//agrosnowman.com/snowman/") up and, as always, its good to follow along.  





His latest post, [99 Men, 1 Woman: That's a list?](//agrosnowman.com/snowman/?p=6") points out the half-blind "top 100 in hockey" list in _The Hockey News_ features the '100 People of Power and Influence' in hockey.   





Clearly these guys (its pretty clear they're guys) aren't from around here.  In Massachusetts women's hockey is flying high.  We've got Olympians, national championship girl's teams, and female leagues galore.  In my daughter's learn to skate hockey program (mostly 4 and 5 year olds) the ratio isn't 50-50, but isn't sure not 99-1.
