Happy Daylight Savings Day!  





Here's the energy/environment rationale for the change (from a [CNN article](http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/03/11/time.change.reut/index.html)): 





_"The energy savings would translate into a 10.8 million-metric-ton reduction in carbon emissions over the next 13 years, Markey said, citing an analysis by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.





...





While 10.8 million metric tons of carbon emissions may sound like a lot, it pales in comparison to the 5.9 billion metric tons the United States emitted just in 2004, according to the U.S. Department of Energy."_





So we're talking about a little less than .02%, or two one-hundredths of a percent.  That may not seem like much, but do 50 or 60 projects like that and you've wiped out most of the increase in carbon emissions in the US since 2000.  Every little bit helps!
