From Dave W:  _ Highly recommended: Chris Lydon's [interview](//blogs.law.harvard.edu/lydon/2003/07/29#a207") with Elaine Scarry, for a perspective on the heroism of the citizens of 9-11. They were more effective than the Pentagon, on less notice, on a much tighter budget. It'll give you an idea of the kind of defense we're buying with all those trillions of dollars.
