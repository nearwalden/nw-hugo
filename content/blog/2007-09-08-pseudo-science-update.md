[Yesterday's post](http://blogs.sun.com/enviro/entry/carbon_pseudo_science) on tree offsets started a good conversation with Adam and Tom Arnold at [Terrapass](http://www.terrapass.com).  Apparently Adam's post was part of an ongoing, and now that I've read the others I find we're on the same page.
In particular, take a read through Adam's [Rules of the road for carbon offsets: the trouble with trees](http://www.terrapass.com/blog/posts/2007/07/rules-of-the-road-for-carbon-offsets-the-trouble-with-trees.html).  It's a more complete treatment of the topic than I provided yesterday.
Bottom line is still the same:  if you're buying offsets, know where they're coming from.  It's up to you, but I'd stay away from the trees.
