The phone is still great.  Good pictures, etc.  I highly recommend the Sony W810i, even if you don't care about the walkman part.





T-Mobile has a few bad spots, but none so far that are important to me.  On the good side, I used it with my laptop on the road this weekend, and the data access was awesome.





Trying out Flickr, Shozu, etc with the camera.  Will report back on results.
