David Coursey takes an interesting pass through the outsourcing conundrum.  It's not a simple issue, and there's plenty of quality positions to go around.

I also think there's something in what he says about taxing the incoming code as an import.  Of course it doesn't work in real life, but there the germ of an idea there.
