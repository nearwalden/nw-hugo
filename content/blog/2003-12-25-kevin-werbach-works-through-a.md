Kevin Werbach works through a deployment schedule for fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) by Verizon based on a blurb saying how many houses they'd pass this year.  Unfortunately I don't believe his linear extrapolation.  Verizon is going to start in the places that are a) easiest and b) have the highest likely subscriber rate for premium services.  My guess is that it's probably more like a logarithmic progression, with every year less than the year before.  [Link](//werbach.com/blog/2003/12/22.html#a1352')
