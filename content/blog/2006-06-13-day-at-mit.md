Spending the day at MIT with the [MIT Energy Research Council](http://web.mit.edu/erc/about/).  This is a major area of investment for MIT, driven by the new President, Susan Hockfield.  





I'm personally very interested in the emerging energy landscape, and how it interacts with the growing energy needs of data centers.  In particular, there's two areas that I see room for improvement:  1) would we design the electrical distribution systems of data centers differently if remotely generated electricity were not the primary energy source, and 2) with adequate WAN capability, where should we put tomorrow's data centers?  





Mote notes from the today's meetings later on...
