Well, hockey is finally on again, which is welcome news around our household.  What's interesting to watch now is how complex it is to restart the league after a 1 year hiatus and a good fraction of the off-season gone (except, of course, for the Cup finalists who would have played into June).  For example, the Bruins only have 4 players signed right now (last time I checked), and [here's the schedule](//sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=2109696") for filling out their roster.  Put this against the backdrop of a brand new compensation system (buried within the 600 page CBA) and its going to be a lot of long nights for the GMs.





The other thing to watch will be the new rule changes.  No more goalies looking like the Pillsbury doughboy.   I also hear there's no more redline, which should be way coolâ€¦
